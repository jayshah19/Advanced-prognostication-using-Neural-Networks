# Advanced-prognostication-using-Neural-Networks

DataSet: owid-covid-data
Link: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

I created this project to anticipate the global COVID-19 dissemination dynamics using neural networks of various structures. I used linear regression, backpropagation, and long short-term memory neural networks to make predictions. The project will demonstrate the partition of the DataSet into training and test sets to accomplish this. I also standardise data and conduct preliminary analyses. Construct models and data sets for two separate neural networks. The next stage I do is to create a forecast and compare the models' accuracy and suitability.

You can use this project with google colab too.
